    	<h3>Using what we just learned (Heading is H3)</h3>
        <p>Here is a good quote that makes a lot of sense. Think about when you begin to day dream or when you are up late at night working on your school work.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote>Some people dream of success. Others stay a wake and make it happen~Author Unknown

        <blockquote>If you plan is for one year, plant rice;
        <br>If you plan is for ten years, plant trees;
        <br>If you plan is for a hundred years,
        <br>Educate children.
        <br>~confucius
